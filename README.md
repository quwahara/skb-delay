# Software keyboard showing up delay with iOS Safari

## Summary

On specific structure HTML, Software keyboard shows up late with iOS Safari
when you touch a input text.
It takes around 38 seconds on my iPad mini by reproduction code.
It won't happen on iOS Chrome browser using same HTML and same iPad mini.


## Reproduction

1. Open below URL by iOS Safari.

https://quwahara.github.io/skb-delay/checkboxes.html

2. Touch a text input to focus it.

3. Waiting for around 38 seconds, the software keyboard shows up.


## Expected result

Showing up software keyboard immediately.


## Actual result

Showing up software keyboard late.


## Impact

We serve a web application to record status of electrical facilities in a large factory.
We have to provide a form that has a lot of input in a single page.
Because the facilities have many statuses.
On our web application, it takes around 5 minitues to show up software keyboard.
It can't be for the everyday use.

### Description

* checkboxes.html -- This HTML file reproduces the symptom.
* radios.html -- This HTML file is pretty similar to checkboxes.html but it has input radio instead of input checkbox. It has no symptom.

The symptom occurs when:

* There are many deep nested DIV tags.
* INPUT checkbox tag and INPUT text tag are paired. 
* The pairs are in the each of deep nested DIV tags.

The symptom doesn't occur:

* After software keyboard was showed onece.
* If you replace INPUT checkbox tag to INPUT radio tag.   
  (radios.html is replaced file. I hope this symptom is to be a hint for a resolution.)
* If you open checkboxes.html by iOS Chrome browser.
